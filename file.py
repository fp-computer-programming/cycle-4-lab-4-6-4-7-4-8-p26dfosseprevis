Create a Python file named lab_4-6.py
Write a program that asks for user input for an animal and a dish. 
Your program should print true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast 
(the first letter of the animal is the same as the first and last letter of the dish).

beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numbers.

Write a program that prompts a uses 5 inputs to prompt a user for a number. 
Store all numbers as a single string with a space in between each numbers 
(i.e num_string = ‘1 2 3 4 5’). Print this string. Using string methods, 
extract the smallest and largest number from the string & print them, 
with a label (i.e smallest num given was 1). 
Print the product of the two numbers you have extracted, with a label (i.e. the product of the two numbers extracted was 5).
